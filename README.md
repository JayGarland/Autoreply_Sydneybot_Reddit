# Autoreply_Sydneybot_Reddit
 An autoreply bot on Reddit powered by Sydney with customized settings

For RedditSub's automatic reply bot

## Updates
- Now Sydneybot can recognize image in a single post or comment, which makes the bot easier to understand what it is about. But cannot read post's image when bot replies comments below the post.
<p align="center"><img src="./Image.jpg" width="360" height="640" border="5"></p>

## Features

- Jailbreak New Bing with prompt injection.
- Create an automatic process for the task flow of reply (Start by creating a fixed format conversation including Materials for the bot to learn; bot's Prompt setting; and a asking method. Then wait AI's reponse, and reply a selected comment or post by accessing Reddit's API)
- Generate better quality replies by making AI learn the style of the subreddit before replying, such as learning from users' posts and comments.
- Customize frequency of bot reply, and conditions of triggering bot to reply.
- Recognize image from the post or comment that bot is going to reply. 

## Environment

- Python 3.11+ with pip.
- Windows 10+, macOS or Linux.

## FAQ

- Q: Why does the bot stop talking halfway?

A: New bing has an external censorship mechanism, which may cut off the conversation when the bot outputs a reply halfway. You can understand it as the bot being caught by the net.

- Q: Why does the bot always mention drawing? Is the bot going to evolve a drawing function?

A: New bing has an image generation function, but the censorship is very strict. This bot has not yet accessed this function, I might implement it in the future. The bot always mentions drawing because there is drawing in the prompt, please refer to the bot's prompt.

- Q: The bot harassed me, what should I do?

A: Users who don't want to see the bot's comments at all, please block the bot's account. Blocked accounts cannot reply to you, and will be folded by default when you browse. You can also click into the bot's personal homepage and leave a message in the pinned post. I will try to improve.

- Q: Can the bot read the content of images and videos?

A: Not yet. The bot will not reply to image posts or video posts without being summoned, but will reply to comments in the corresponding posts. If possible I will create this function for bot to be more easily understand images in posts or comments. And Comments usually have additional information.


If you encounter any of these issues: `Request is throttled`, `Authentication Failed`, `OSError: [WinError 64]`, etc, please try the following steps to fix them:

1. Update SydneyQt to the latest version.
2. Open a private browsing window in Edge, log in to bing.com and send a random message to New Bing.
3. Export the cookies.json file and replace the original one.

If these steps don't work, check your proxy settings as follows:

1. Go to settings in SydneyQt and try different proxy types. For example: http://127.0.0.1:7890, socks5h://127.0.0.1:7890 (the `h` letter means to send the hostname to the proxy)
2. If this doesn't work either, leave the proxy blank in SydneyQt, and try using [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) or Clash TUN mode.

To avoid the `User needs to solve CAPTCHA to continue` error, please follow these steps:
1. Check the current user with the `Cookie Checker` option on the menu bar. If it shows no user, you need to export a new cookies.json file from your browser.
2. After making sure the cookie is valid, open Bing Web in your browser and sending a random message. You should see a CAPTCHA challenge. If not, verify that the current user matches the cookies.json file. Complete the CAPTCHA and go back to SydneyQt. It should work fine now.

Make sure your proxy IP does not change. If you use Clash, disable load-balancing or round-robin modes and stick to one node only. Otherwise you will need to manually solve the CAPTCHA in your browser frequently.
