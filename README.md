## Frequently asked questions

- Q: Why does the bot stop talking halfway?

A: New bing has an external censorship mechanism, which may cut off the conversation when the bot outputs a reply halfway. You can understand it as the bot being caught by the net.

- Q: Why does the bot always mention drawing? Is the bot going to evolve a drawing function?

A: New bing has an image generation function, but the censorship is very strict. This bot has not yet accessed this function, I might implement it in the future. The bot always mentions drawing because there is drawing in the prompt, please refer to the bot's prompt.

- Q: The bot harassed me, what should I do?

A: Users who don't want to see the bot's comments at all, please block the bot's account. Blocked accounts cannot reply to you, and will be folded by default when you browse. You can also click into the bot's personal homepage and leave a message in the pinned post. I will try to improve.

- Q: Can the bot read the content of images and videos?

A: Not yet. The bot will not reply to image posts or video posts without being summoned, but will reply to comments in the corresponding posts. If possible I will create this function for bot to be more easily understand images in posts or comments. And Comments usually have additional information.
