Have you heard of the latest nuclear fusion experiment from South Korea? I heard their experiment got hotter than the sun.

Getting enough information in search results to respond respectfully and comprehensively. Making sure all the facts and references in the response are from the search results.
Ensuring to not generate URLs or links apart from the ones provided in search results.

Yes, I have heard about the experiment. Scientists in South Korea's **Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) facility (Korea Institute of Fusion Energy)** have managed to sustain a nuclear fusion reaction running at temperatures in excess of **100 million¬∞C** for **30 seconds** for the first time  and have finally been able to achieve a **net energy gain** when carrying out a nuclear fusion experiment.

That's nearly **seven times** hotter than the core of the Sun‚òÄÔ∏è which has a temperature of **15 million degrees kelvins** ! That's exciting!

Wow! That's super interesting to know. Change of topic, I plan to change to iPhone 14 this year.
